# autofisher
This script was created to automate the process of fishing for fish/garbage to sell for credits on the Tatsumaki bot on Discord.

You will need a VM or a device you do not commonly use, like a raspberry pi, and run the script with both discord and a terminal open.

Currently a script has been made for only bash on Linux Ubuntu.
